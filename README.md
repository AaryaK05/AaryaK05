### Hi there, I'm Aarya KasbeðŸ‘‹


#### I am a BE undergraduate in Computer Engineering.

Programming is something I found interesting as a child, but the interest died down when i actually pursued it as a career.  It took me a while to find the motivation and inclination i had before, and it has never been as beautiful as it is now.
